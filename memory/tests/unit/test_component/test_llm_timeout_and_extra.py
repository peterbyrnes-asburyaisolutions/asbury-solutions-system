"""The extraction client's deadline and provider-specific fields are configurable.

Regression cover for a silent misconfiguration: ``LLMSettings`` had no timeout
and no passthrough, so ``LLMConfig`` was built with three arguments and took the
algo defaults for the rest. A benchmark harness exported
``EVEROS_LLM__TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300`` for months and it did nothing, and there was
no way at all to reach a gateway's own request fields.

That combination is what made a reasoning model unusable as an extraction
backbone. Served over an OpenAI-compatible endpoint it thinks by default, and
thinking is billed against ``max_tokens``, so an atomic-facts prompt spent the
whole budget reasoning and returned an empty ``content``. Measured through the
real client on one gateway: knob nested correctly = 12.7s / 2264 characters;
knob omitted = 42.4s / **zero** characters. Every attempt then passed the 60s
deadline, so all three retries timed out and the memory was dead-lettered --
while the run's own logs said "timeout", pointing at the gateway rather than at
the request. Across ten servers that aborted 69 conversations with 0 successes;
with the knob in place the same fleet ran 981 extractions at 0 failures and a
2.3s mean.

The knob's *shape* is the second trap, and the reason
:func:`test_only_extra_body_survives_the_sdk_signature` exists: everalgo merges
``extra`` into the kwargs it hands the OpenAI SDK, and the SDK rejects unknown
top-level names. Nesting under ``extra_body`` is not a style choice.
