"""A strategy that hangs must lose its slot, not the whole engine.

Regression cover for a full-process stall. ``OMEConfig`` bounded retries and
recovered orphans left by a *previous* process, but nothing bounded a live
attempt. A coroutine parked on an await with no deadline of its own -- an
``asyncio.Lock`` held by another stuck coroutine, a connection-pool wait -- kept
its ``max_concurrent_runs`` slot indefinitely: it never raised, so it never
retried, and its record stayed RUNNING forever.

Observed in a benchmark run: 60 of 64 slots parked on one lock, which starved
every other strategy in the process. Extraction stopped for 6.7 hours while the
server still answered HTTP and every liveness signal read healthy -- the queue
depth was the only thing that moved, and it moved the wrong way.
