"""A fleet must not serve empty sibling directories instead of the store it was given.

`_ServerFleet` derives one root per server -- `<root>_s0 .. <root>_s{N-1}` -- because
the
index queue lock is exclusive, and uses the given root verbatim only when N == 1. So
pointing `--everos-root` at a single prebuilt store while asking for more than one
server
reads that store's *name* and serves N siblings of it. Those siblings are empty, and in
this workspace they already exist: `everos_store_s0` and `everos_store_s1` sit next to
`everos_store` in every shared store, left over from a sharded build.

Measured on a store holding 711 episodes: 20 of 20 questions returned zero episodes in
1.15s each, `search_error` was empty, and the run exited 0. With the guard, the same
command returns episodes for every question at ~44s each. The shipped configs default to
`servers = 10`, so this is the path a first run takes.

The failure shape is the one this repository keeps producing: a complete-looking run
over
nothing. It is worth a guard rather than a note in a README.
