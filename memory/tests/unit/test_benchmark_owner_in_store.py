"""A store that does not hold a conversation's owner must stop the run.

The failure this prevents leaves no trace anywhere. A search against a store without the
owner returns an empty episode list with HTTP 200; every question is then answered from
nothing, graded wrong, and the run finishes with `exit 0` and a report. The number is
built entirely from absent evidence and nothing in the output says so.

Reaching that state takes one plausible mistake: aligning a conversation with the wrong
server/root pair. Measured on EverMemBench, whose five topics lived in five stores,
conv0 retrieved 10/10 and conv1 retrieved 0/10 when both were pointed at the first
shard, and the run reported 40.0% rather than failing.

The check reads markdown rather than issuing a search: markdown is the store's source of
truth, and an empty search result is the symptom under diagnosis, not a usable test.
