"""Application settings.

Loaded by :func:`load_settings`. Source priority (later wins):

    1. ``config/default.toml`` (shipped values; lowest priority)
    2. ``<root>/everos.toml`` (user config; optional; ``<root>`` resolved by
       :func:`resolve_root`)
    3. ``EVEROS_<SECTION>__<KEY>`` environment variables
    4. Init args passed programmatically (highest priority)

The memory root is resolved by :func:`resolve_root`:
``explicit arg > EVEROS_ROOT env > ~/.everos``.

The settings tree mirrors the TOML structure: ``settings.sqlite.busy_timeout_ms``
maps to ``[sqlite].busy_timeout_ms`` and to ``EVEROS_SQLITE__BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS``.

``load_settings`` is ``functools.cache``-d so callers in hot paths (e.g.
:mod:`everos.component.utils.datetime`) don't re-parse the TOML on every
call. Tests that mutate environment variables must call
``load_settings.cache_clear()`` after the mutation to invalidate.

      longer ago than this become eligible for deletion. It only has to outlive
      an in-flight read (sub-second). Shorter shrinks the transient footprint of
      superseded data fragments, but note it also decides how long index files
      keep a manifest that names them: below LanceDB's 7-day unverified window,
      index files lose that reference and wait out the full 7 days.

      correctness — a missed sweep only defers cleanup.
