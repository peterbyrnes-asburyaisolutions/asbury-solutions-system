"""Episode LLM-guided multi-round retrieval (per-sub-query RRF blocks).

Genuinely *iterative* multi-round retrieval, unlike ``agentic`` (a fixed round1
+ single round2 fallback). Each round an injected **decider** looks at the
question + retrieved evidence and, in one shot:

  1. **selects** the *core* memories that carry information the answer needs,
  2. decides to **stop** (the core answers a self-contained question), else
  3. **expands** into one focused sub-query per still-missing aspect (multi-query
     gap coverage), grounded in the core carried forward.

Retrieval substrate — the design's defining choice. Every current sub-query is
recalled (BM25 + vector) and fused with RRF **independently**, so a facet-gold
ranked #1 for a single sub-query is never diluted by the other sub-queries'
consensus hits (the failure mode of merging every sub-query into one pool). The
decider sees one labelled block per sub-query (round 0 = a single
original-question block) with a single GLOBAL index, plus a CORE-SO-FAR section
tagging each kept item with the sub-query that surfaced it. There is **no
cross-encoder** anywhere — RRF is the only ranking (the CE was measured
net-negative: it scored gold below RRF order and buried much of it past rank 20).

The accumulated core also shapes the output: the final top-k is assembled
**core-first** (a hard guarantee), then each sub-query's top non-core candidate
is guaranteed a slot, then the rest is filled by MAX RRF score across sub-queries
(max, not sum — a specialist that is #1 for one sub-query keeps that score).
Evidence selection therefore genuinely shapes what is injected — the lever a
Phase-2 RL policy learns to control.

The decider is a *pluggable hook* — the whole point of the file:

* Phase 1 (default here): :class:`LLMRoundDecider` prompts an off-the-shelf
  LLM (no training).
* Phase 2 (RL): swap in a trained small policy with the same
  :class:`RoundDecider` interface. **This loop then IS the RL environment** —
  only the decider changes; the retrieval substrate is identical.

Retrieval explainability: setting ``EVEROS_LLMMR_TRACE_DUMP=<jsonl>`` appends one
per-round record (blocked evidence shown -> core selected -> stop / next
queries) plus a final-injection record (the assembled top-k with per-slot
provenance), so a real Phase-1 run yields the GRPO cold-start (behavior-cloning)
corpus. Unset by default — the dump adds nothing to the production path.

JSON object.
You are shown a RETRIEVED SUBSET of memory, never all of it. "Not shown here" \
does NOT mean "not in memory" — it may just not have been retrieved yet.

What you see each round:
- QUESTION: the user's original question (unchanged every round).
- CORE SO FAR: items you already selected in earlier rounds, each tagged with \
the sub-query that surfaced it ("original question" on round 0). These are \
ALREADY kept — never re-list them; use them only to judge what is still missing.
- CANDIDATES THIS ROUND: on round 0, ONE block retrieved for the original \
question; on later rounds, ONE BLOCK PER SUB-QUERY, each headed by that \
sub-query. Items carry a SINGLE global index across all blocks. The same memory \
may appear in several blocks — that just means several angles retrieved it.

Do two things:

1. CORE (required): global indices of every candidate shown THIS ROUND that \
could carry information the answer needs — favour RECALL over minimality.
   - A needed fact (an age, price, date, name, count) is often an INCIDENTAL \
detail inside an episode about a DIFFERENT topic. Judge by whether the item \
touches the same PERSON / ENTITY / PLACE / ACTIVITY / TIME-WINDOW the question \
is about — NOT by whether its headline topic matches.
   - SCAN EVERY BLOCK top to bottom; answer-bearing evidence is often ranked \
LOW in its block.
   - For a count / total / comparison / ordering, core EVERY item that \
contributes an instance — a multi-part answer usually needs several items from \
different sessions.
   - If the SAME memory appears in two blocks, core it ONCE (either index).
   - Return an empty list ONLY when nothing shown touches the question at all.

2. NEXT_QUERIES: KEEP SEARCHING (default) or STOP.
   - STOP (set "next_queries" to []) ONLY when the question is a SINGLE, \
self-contained fact AND the core you already hold answers it unambiguously.
   - OTHERWISE keep searching: one focused sub-query per still-missing aspect \
(up to {max_sub}). Each sub-query must NAME the specific entity / aspect no \
current block has covered — never paraphrase a sub-query already asked, never \
issue a broad topical query.

  0: Vet visit - Nora brought her cat Biscuit, a Ragdoll, in for shots.
  1: Weekend plans - Nora said she adopted a cat last spring.

Example 2 (later round, running total across sub-queries):

CANDIDATES THIS ROUND:
