"""EverMemBench adapter.

Owner is the topic id verbatim (``"01"`` .. ``"05"``), which is also the prefix the
store puts on its session names.

Gold is the hard part. The benchmark cites evidence as dia ids (``D581:4``) while the
store names sessions ``<topic>_<Group N>_<date>``. The bridge between them is the
converter's own flattening order: one session per NON-EMPTY (date, group) pair, dates
ascending, groups in numeric order ("Group 10" after "Group 2"), session index 1-based,
and the counter rolls back for a pair whose messages are all empty.

A constant offset in that walk still produces well-formed session ids, so the mapping is
validated by hit rate rather than by shape: real retrieval recalls 0.41 of this gold
against 0.014 for a same-size random draw from the same topic's session pool -- a 29x
separation. Reproduce that check after touching this function.

Your task is to answer the question using ONLY the information in the memories.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from the group chat.
2. Pay special attention to timestamps to determine when events occurred.
3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories.
4. If memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.
5. If the question involves time references (like "last year", "two months ago"), calculate the actual date based on the memory's timestamp.
6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years in your answer.
7. Pay attention to who said what - the memories may involve multiple participants.
8. The answer should be concise and specific (under 5-6 words when possible).
9. Do NOT output any reasoning steps, explanations, or extra text beyond the final answer.

# APPROACH (Think step by step internally):
1. Examine all memories that contain information related to the question.
2. Examine timestamps and content carefully.
3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.
4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), do so.
5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.

    (3) a generated answer
which you will score as CORRECT/WRONG.

The questions are about events, facts, or details mentioned in multi-person group chat conversations.
The gold answer is usually a concise answer that includes the key information.

For example:
Question: What project was announced on January 9th?
Gold answer: Carbon Emission Accounting Platform

The generated answer might be longer, but you should be generous with your grading -
as long as it contains the same key information as the gold answer, it should be CORRECT.

For time-related questions, the gold answer will be a specific date/time.
The generated answer might use different formats (e.g., "May 7th" vs "7 May" vs "2025-05-07"),
but as long as it refers to the same date/time, it should be CORRECT.

For the specific window of date, a +/- 1 day difference is acceptable due to timezone processing variations.

For multiple choice questions where the gold answer is a letter (A/B/C/D),
the generated answer should match exactly to be CORRECT.

Now grade this:
Question: {question}
Gold answer: {golden_answer}
Generated answer: {generated_answer}

First, provide a short (one sentence) explanation of your reasoning,
then finish with CORRECT or WRONG.
Do NOT include both CORRECT and WRONG in your response.
