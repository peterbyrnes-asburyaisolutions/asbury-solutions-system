"""Ranked-retrieval metrics over the injected episode list.

These grade the list the ANSWER model actually sees -- assembly order, ``top_k``
included -- which is the right target for "did the context contain the evidence". For
grading the decider's own choice use :mod:`benchmarks.metrics.core` instead; the two
answer different questions and were conflated once already.

Relevance is session-level: an episode counts as relevant when its session id is in
gold. Duplicate sessions in the list are credited once for recall and each time for
precision, matching how a reader would experience the context.

nDCG credits a session once, at its first occurrence, and its ideal ranking is
``min(len(gold), k)`` relevant items -- gold the search never returned included. Both
halves are load-bearing and neither works alone. An IDCG built from the retrieved
relevance list, as this did, cannot see the gold that was missed, so half the gold
recalled scored ``ndcg@2 = 1.0`` beside ``recall@2 = 0.5``: a ranking metric that
reports a perfect score for a ranking with half the answer missing. Fixing only the
IDCG then lets duplicates push nDCG above 1, because ``gold={a}`` with
``ranked=[a, a]`` earns two gains against a one-item ideal.
